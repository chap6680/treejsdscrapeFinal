Node Script written to scrape website - Treehouse 

This is an introduction Node activity for me.  
  1 - New to node and how it works.  
  2 - Learned how to create your own "NPM"  
  3 - Scraping the web and saving the data - challenging, but fairly doable.  Can be tedious, depending on the info and site setup.
